This frontend project is to use the skills learned at FreeCodeCamp.

The stories from this project are listed on [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine/).

Below I've listed them incase that changes;

1. User Story #1: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding `id="quote-box"`.
1. User Story #2: Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with a corresponding `id="text"`.
1. User Story #3: Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with a corresponding `id="author"`.
1. User Story #4: Within `#quote-box`, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".
1. User Story #5: Within `#quote-box`, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".
1. User Story #6: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".
1. User Story #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".
1. User Story #8: When the `#new-quote` button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the `#text` element.
1. User Story #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the `#author` element.
1. User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in it's href attribute to tweet the current quote.
1. User Story #11: The `#quote-box` wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
